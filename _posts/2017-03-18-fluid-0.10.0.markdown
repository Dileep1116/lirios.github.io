Fluid is our toolkit for cross-platform and responsive applications that supports Material Design and optionally the Microsoft Universal design language.

Originally an Hawaii library (see [here][fluid-hawaii]), Fluid is the continuation of the project using QtQuick Controls 2 and merging code from [qml-material][qml-material].
It replaces [qml-material][qml-material] which was using QtQuick Controls 1.

We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Fluid 0.10.0.

Features:

* Requires Qt 5.8.0 or later
* Fixed qmake warnings for per-project installation
* Fixed build of fluid-demo for per-project installation
* Create .pri so that qmake projects can link to Fluid with a system-wide installation
* Fix TabbedPage import
* Rename FluidWindow to ApplicationWindow for consistency
* Add new Fluid.Layouts module
* Add InputDialog to Fluid.Controls
* Add AlertDialog to Fluid.Controls to replace the old Dialog
* Pick icon colors from QtQuick.Controls.Material 2.1
* Add a MenuItem with an icon to Fluid.Controls
* Make fluid-demo pages flickable
* Add hamburger icon to open navigation drawer in fluid-demo
* Complete TabbedPage in Fluid.Controls
* Support centered and fixed size tabs in TabbedPage
* Align first tab to left keyline with TabbedPage
* Implement action overflow in AppBar
