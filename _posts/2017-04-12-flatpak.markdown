We are proud to introduce Liri runtime and apps on Flatpak!

[Flatpak][flatpak] is a new technology for building and installing desktop applications
and we are working on getting our [cross-platform applications][liri-io-apps] and runtime packaged.

The first milestone has been reached and we now have the Liri runtime with all the common dependencies
for the apps, the SDK bits to build the apps with, as well as the following apps:

* Browser
* Calculator
* Files
* Text

## Try it out

[Flatpak][flatpak] is very easy to use: the first time you install an application it will download
and install the dependencies.

We have also prepared files to make the installation fast and easy.

## Install the runtime

When an app is installed, the runtime is automatically downloaded and installed so you usually
don't need to perform the following actions.

Anyway for the sake of completeness here's the steps.

First you need to add the remote repository:

```sh
flatpak --user remote-add liri https://repo.liri.io/flatpak/liri.flatpakrepo
```

Install the runtime:

```sh
flatpak --user install liri io.liri.Platform
```

Pictures are worth thousand words so here's a [video][asciinema-runtime].

## Install the apps

Install Browser:

```sh
flatpak --user install https://repo.liri.io/flatpak/io.liri.Browser.flatpakref
```

Install Calculator:

```sh
flatpak --user install https://repo.liri.io/flatpak/io.liri.Calculator.flatpakref
```

Install Files:

```sh
flatpak --user install https://repo.liri.io/flatpak/io.liri.Files.flatpakref
```

Install Text:

```sh
flatpak --user install https://repo.liri.io/flatpak/io.liri.Text.flatpakref
```

A video of the procedure is [here][asciinema-apps]

## Run the apps

Run Browser:

```sh
flatpak run io.liri.Browser
```

Run Calculator:

```sh
flatpak run io.liri.Calculator
```

Run Files:

```
