Fluid is our toolkit for cross-platform and responsive applications development that supports the Material Design design language.

It replaces [qml-material](https://github.com/papyros/qml-material) which was using QtQuick Controls 1.

This is the first *stable* release.

We aim to maintain API compatibility until the next major release.

Features:

* Requires Qt 5.10
* Supports `icon` grouped property
* Remove all the `iconName` and `iconSource` properties: use the new `icon` grouped property instead
* Fix `SearchBar` always showing placeholder text on mobile
* Retrieve new Material Design icons categories automatically
* Retrieve 24px icon counterpart when Material Design collection doesn't include the 48px version
* Add macOS support to minimalqmake
* Replace `Tumbler` used in `TimeSelector` with a `ListView`
* Add Material Design icons collection to the demo
* Add system icons to the demo
* Change orientation in `DatePicker`, `DateTimePicker` and `TimePicker` and set a default value based on the screen orientation so that the control automatically fits
* Implement `DatePicker`, `DateTimePicker` and `TimePicker` API with C++
* Move types used as internal details to a private import
* Use system-wide qbs-shared if requested
* Add `SearchBar::expanded` property and improve keyboard handling
* `NavigationDrawer` now lets you add whatever contents you want
* `NavigationListView` is the old implementation that uses a `ListView`
* Add a `ScrollView` around the `NavigationListView` list view
* Allow to specify a custom delegate in `NavigationListView`
* Fix macOS builds
* Remove `IconButton` and add a custom `ToolButton`
* Redesign `Action` around the Qt Quick Controls 2 type
* Remove `MenuItem`
* Don't give focus to tabs in `TabbedPage`
* Install a `Fluid` `qbs` module with version information
* Embed Material icons as resources or install them alongside the `Fluid.Controls` QML plugin
* Fix `Page.push()` method
* Replace `InfoBar` with `SnackBar` with support for both mobile and desktop
* Add `Card` to `Fluid.Templates`
* Install Qt Assistant documentation
