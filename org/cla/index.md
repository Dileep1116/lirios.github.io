Liri is asking all past and future contributors to sign a contributor license agreement.

Every contributor of non trivial amounts of code (more than just a line or two) to any of our
projects should sign such a document.

If somebody is unable to sign the document, their contribution (whether it be code, or
documentation or string translations) may need to be removed from Liri.

The CLA ensures that Liri has clear license to all its contributions, which in turns lets us
guarantee to users that there is no differently-licensed material.

### Questions

We have a [Contributor License Agreement FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/org/cla/faq/) which explains
more about what the CLA means and why we are doing this.

### What's next?

1. Download the [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/lirios/lirios/raw/documents/cla/Liri-Individual-1.0.pdf)
